# ClickClackArch

Turn your mushy membrane keyboard into a thunderous mechanical beast.

## What is this?

A Python script that plays Cherry MX Blue-style sounds when you type. Because your coworkers weren't annoyed enough already.

## Requirements

- **Linux only** (uses evdev - sorry Windows/Mac folks, skill issue)
- PulseAudio (for the clicky sounds)
- Python 3 with numpy and evdev
- Your user in the `input` group (or just yolo it with sudo)

## Installation

```bash
# Arch btw
sudo pacman -S python-numpy python-evdev

# Or use a venv like a civilized person
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install numpy evdev
```

## Usage

```bash
python mechanical_typer.py
# or with venv
.venv/bin/python mechanical_typer.py
```

Then type anywhere. Annoy everyone. You're welcome.

## Permissions

If it yells about not finding a keyboard:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
# Then log out and back in (yes, actually log out)
```

Or just run with `sudo` if you like living dangerously.

## Features

- Cherry MX Blue click sounds (the superior switch, fight me)
- Bottom-out thock
- Case resonance
- Spacebar has extra THONK
- Wayland compatible (because it's not 2015 anymore)

## License

Do whatever you want with it. It's a keyboard sound script, not a nuclear reactor.
